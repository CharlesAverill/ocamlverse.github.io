# Unicode

* [uutf](https://github.com/dbuenzli/uutf):
Streaming Unicode codec. This library is well maintained, and up to date with the latest Unicode standard.
* [Camomile](https://github.com/yoriyuki/Camomile):
An older Unicode support library. Covers only Unicode 3.2.
Additionally, Camomile requires a whole bunch of data files to be present in the correct place,
making distribution of executables difficult.
