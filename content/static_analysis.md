# Static Analysis

Like compilation, static analysis is another domain where OCaml excels.

## OCaml Analysis

* [Ocamllint](https://github.com/cryptosense/ocamllint)  - Ocamllint detects common errors in OCaml code
* [Mascot](http://mascot.x9c.fr/)  - Mascot is a style-checker for OCaml sources
* [BetterErrors](https://github.com/npm-ml/BetterErrors)  - BetterErrors improves error messages of the OCaml compiler (Make OCaml Errors Great Again.)

## Other Languages

* [pfff](https://github.com/facebook/pfff)  â€“ pfff is a set of tools and APIs to perform some static analysis, dynamic analysis, code visualizations, code navigations, or style-preserving source-to-source transformations such as refactorings on source code.
* [infer](https://github.com/facebook/infer)  - infer is a static analyzer for Java, C and Objective-C
* [flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow)  - flow is a static type checker for JavaScript
* [BAP](https://github.com/BinaryAnalysisPlatform/bap)  - BAP is a reverse engineering and program analysis platform that targets binary programs.
* [SLAyer](https://github.com/Microsoft/SLAyer)  - SLAyer is an automatic formal verification tool that uses separation logic to verify memory safety of C programs.
