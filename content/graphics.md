# Graphics

## 2D

* [Wall](https://github.com/let-def/wall):
Vector drawing library using OpenGL as the backend.
  * [Presentation on Wall at ICFP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQB8kBkHxjk)
* [archimedes](http://archimedes.forge.ocamlcore.org/):
2D plotting library.
* [cairo2](https://github.com/Chris00/ocaml-cairo):
Bindings to Cairo, a 2D Vector Graphics Library. Integrates well with lablgtk.
* [Vg](https://github.com/dbuenzli/vg):
Declarative 2D vector graphics for OCaml.
* [TSDL](http://erratique.ch/software/tsdl):
An OCaml module providing thin bindings to the cross-platform SDL library.
* [OcamlSDL2](https://github.com/fccm/OCamlSDL2):
Bindings to the SDL2 library.

### ReasonML

* [Reprocessing](https://github.com/Schmavery/reprocessing):
A Reason 2d graphics library inspired by Processing.

## 3D

* [glMLite](http://www.linux-nantes.org/~fmonnier/OCaml/GL/):
OpenGL bindings for OCaml. Provides an experimental functional API.
* [lablgl](https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/lablgl/):
Interface to OpenGL. Integrates well with lablgtk.
* [tgls](http://erratique.ch/software/tgls):
Thin bindings to OpenGL 3.{2,3},4.{0,1,2,3,4} and OpenGL ES {2,3}.
* [glfw-ocaml](https://github.com/SylvainBoilard/GLFW-OCaml):
Bindings to [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), an OpenGL library providing OS-specific
functionality, such as window, surface and input management.
* [ocaml-glfw](https://github.com/rizo/ocaml-glfw):
Another library with bindings to [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/).

## Linear Algebra

* [OWL](https://github.com/owlbarn/owl):
Numerical library, useful for fast linear algebra operations.
* [reason-gl-matrix](https://github.com/bryphe/reason-gl-matrix):
Bindings to [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm),
the OpenGL linear algebra C++ library for graphics.
