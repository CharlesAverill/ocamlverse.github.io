# Foreign Function Interface

Interop with C/C++ is the most natural option for OCaml, since the runtime is partially written in C.

## C FFI

* [ctypes](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes): Modern library for binding to C libraries using pure OCaml.
You should always try to bind to C code using ctypes before trying the older method.
* [ppx_cstubs](https://github.com/fdopen/ppx_cstubs):
Possibly the easiest solution for FFI with C, allowing you to place C code in your OCaml files.
Everything else is taken care of for you.
* [cstruct](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cstruct): Library to access C-style structures from OCaml.
It comes with a ppx preprocessor and variants for lwt and async.
* The older way of binding to C code is to create stubs in C which call functions in the OCaml runtime.
This method is error prone, and you're advised to stay away from it unless it's absolutely necessary.
* [ocaml-main-program-in-c](https://github.com/johnwhitington/ocaml-main-program-in-c) â€“ Example build system for making mixed C/Ocaml binaries where the main program is in C.

## Python FFI

* [Py](https://github.com/zshipko/ocaml-py): Library for interacting with Python 3.5 using Ctypes.
* [Pyml](https://github.com/thierry-martinez/pyml): Library for interacting with python. Uses C stubs.
* [lymp](https://github.com/dbousque/lymp): Another library for interacting with Python, this one using a Python process.

## Rust FFI

* [rust-ocaml-derive](https://github.com/ahrefs/rust-ocaml-derive): provides an FFI with Rust.
Works on both the OCaml-to-Rust and Rust-to-OCaml directions.
