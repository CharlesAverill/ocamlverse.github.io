# OCaml's Future

Some interesting developments coming up in OCaml's future:

## Modular Implicits
A type-based dispatch similar to Haskell's typeclasses.
As [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01895.pdf) clarifies, creating typeclasses in OCaml is harder due to the way
it preserves type abstraction.
While the community eagerly awaits this solution, its implementation appears to be years away currently.
