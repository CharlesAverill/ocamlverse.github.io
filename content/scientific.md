## Numerical Computing/Data Science

* [Owl](https://ocaml.xyz):
OCaml numerical library: dense and sparse matrix, linear algebra, regressions, maths and stats functions.
* [pareto](https://github.com/superbobry/pareto):
Statistics library using GSL.
* [SPOC](https://mathiasbourgoin.github.io/SPOC/):
Allows computing in OCaml with GPUs.
Supports both CUDA and OpenCL.
* [lacaml](https://mmottl.github.io/lacaml/):
OCaml bindings for BLAS/LAPACK (high-performance linear algebra Fortran libraries).
* [sklearn](https://github.com/lehy/ocaml-sklearn):

Bindings to the [glpk](http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html) linear programming kit.
* [zarith](https://github.com/ocaml/Zarith):
Arithmetic over arbitrary precision integers and rational numbers.
Uses [gmplib](https://gmplib.org/).
Note that operations can be more expensive than calling `gmplib` directly.
* [gmp-ocaml](https://github.com/ytomino/gmp-ocaml):
Low-level bindings to the [gmplib](https://gmplib.org/).
