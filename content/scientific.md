## Numerical Computing/Data Science

* [Owl](https://ocaml.xyz):
OCaml numerical library: dense and sparse matrix, linear algebra, regressions, maths and stats functions.
* [pareto](https://github.com/superbobry/pareto):
Statistics library using GSL.
* [SPOC](https://mathiasbourgoin.github.io/SPOC/):
Allows computing in OCaml with GPUs.
Supports both CUDA and OpenCL.
* [lacaml](https://mmottl.github.io/lacaml/):
OCaml bindings for BLAS/LAPACK (high-performance linear algebra Fortran libraries).
* [sklearn](https://github.com/lehy/ocaml-sklearn):
OCaml bindings to python's scikit-learn, numpy and scipy.
These are heavy duty libraries used by professional data scientists.
* [onumerical](https://github.com/cheshire/onumerical):
Numerical library for OCaml.
* [oml](https://github.com/hammerlab/oml):
OCaml library for general numerical work.
* [slap](https://github.com/akabe/slap):
A linear algebra library in OCaml with type-based static size checking for matrix operations.
* [obandit](https://github.com/freuk/obandit):
OCaml library for multi-armed bandits.
* [ocephes](https://github.com/rleonid/ocephes):
Bindings to frequently used `C` special functions library.
* [glpk](https://github.com/smimram/ocaml-glpk):
Bindings to the [glpk](http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html) linear programming kit.
* [zarith](https://github.com/ocaml/Zarith):
Arithmetic over arbitrary precision integers and rational numbers.
Uses [gmplib](https://gmplib.org/).
Note that operations can be more expensive than calling `gmplib` directly.
