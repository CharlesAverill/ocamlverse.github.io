# Community

OCaml has quite a few places where you can go to communicate with the community and learn about the language:

## Where to find OCamlers

* [OCaml Discord Chat](https://tinyurl.com/discord-ocaml) is a chat server for everything related to OCaml.
Pop by and ask a question or just say hi.
The Discord server also provides a bridge to IRC, where some of the community still resides.
* [OCaml The Discourse Web Forum](https://discuss.ocaml.org/) is a friendly, online forum for OCaml discussion.
If you prefer to have long-form conversation rather than just chatting, this is the place to do it.
* [The OCaml IRC Chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#freenode_#ocaml:matrix.org):
OCaml's more established chat room.
You can access this via Discord as well (see above).
* [The Official OCaml Mailing List](http://caml.inria.fr/resources/forums.en.html):
this precedes the Discourse forum but is currently not well used.
Some people aren't on Discourse but *are* subscribed to the mailing list.
* [The OCaml Subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/ocaml):
contains both news and discussions about OCaml, but tends to have minimal traffic.
* [The OCaml github page](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml):
where development and some discussion on the internals of the OCaml language takes place.
* [OCaml Mantis](https://caml.inria.fr/mantis/main_page.php):
Bugs with the compiler, runtime or language are reported here rather than on github.
You'll need to sign up for an account.

## OCaml News

* [OCaml Planet](http://ocaml.org/community/planet/):
an aggregator for many blogs concerning OCaml or some related concept.
* [The Official OCaml Website](http://ocaml.org/):
a central hub for online OCaml information.
* [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/):
OPAM is OCaml's package manager.
You can keep track of the latest or most popular packages here.

## ReasonML Discussion

ReasonML is a new syntax on top of OCaml, and as such many discussions pertaining to Reason apply to OCaml as well:

* [ReasonML Discord Chat](https://discordapp.com/invite/reasonml):
the main ReasonML chat channel. It has an OCaml room for some OCaml questions.
* [The ReasonML Discourse](https://reasonml.chat/):
a forum for discussing Reason-related issues.
